    <h1 className="text-red-500">Section 80C </h1> 
    The Government offers you tax breaks on certain types of savings under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. You can invest up to a maximum of <b>Rs.1,50,000</b> and your income gets reduced by this investment amount. So, you don’t have to pay any tax on this amount at all!
    
    <p className="text-md ">Qualifying Investments</p>
    
    Some of the tax saving plans offered under Section 80C are:
    
    Provident Fund (PF) & Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF): PF is automatically deducted from your salary. Both you and your employer contribute to it. While employer’s contribution is exempted from tax, your contribution (i.e., employee’s contribution) is counted towards section 80C investments. You also have the option to contribute additional amounts through voluntary contributions (VPF).
    
    Public Provident Fund (PPF): PPF Is a popular long term saving scheme. Minimum amount of contribution is Rs. 500 and maximum is Rs. 1,50,000. Interest to be paid on PPF balance is as decided by the Government. As per current rules such interest is tax free in the hands of the investor.
    
    Life Insurance Premiums: Any amount that you pay towards life insurance premiums for yourself, your spouse or your children can also be included in Section 80C deduction. Please note that the life insurance premium paid by you for your parents (father / mother / both) or your in-laws is not eligible for deduction under section 80C. If you are paying a premium for more than one insurance policy, all premiums can be included. It is not necessary to have an insurance policy from Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) – Eligible Insurance bought from even private players is considered here.
    
    Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS): There are some mutual fund (MF) schemes specially created to offer tax savings. These are called Equity Linked Savings Scheme, or ELSS. The investments that you make in ELSS are eligible for deduction under Sec 80C.
    
    Home Loan Principal Repayment: The Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) that you pay every month to repay your home loan consists of two components – Principal and Interest. The principal component of the EMI qualifies for deduction under Sec 80C. There is tax exemption available for the interest component also as per Income Tax rules.
    
    Stamp Duty and Registration Charges for a Home: The amount you pay as stamp duty when you buy a house and the amount you pay for registration of the documents can be claimed as deduction under section 80C in the year of purchase.
    
    National Savings Certificates (NSC): National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a small saving instrument eligible for section 80C tax benefit. Currently, the NSC is available with a 5 year tenure. The interest accrued every year is liable to tax (i.e., to be included in your taxable income), but the interest is also deemed to be reinvested and thus eligible for section 80C deduction.
    
    5-Year Bank Fixed Deposits (FDs): Tax-saving fixed deposits (FDs) of scheduled banks with tenure of 5 years are also entitled for Section 80C deduction.
    
    NABARD Rural Bonds: Certain bonds issued by NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development) also qualify for deduction under Section 80C. However, the availability of these bonds for investment depends on Government notifications. In recent years, these have not been available for Section 80C investment.
    
    Unit Linked Insurance Plans: ULIPs cover life insurance with benefits of equity investments. These plans have attracted the attention of investors and tax savers not only because they can help you save on tax but they also provide decent returns in the long term.
    
    Education/Tuition Fee: If you have children going to school, then the tuition fees paid to school is tax deductible. Note that you can avail this deduction only on the tuition fee (not transport fee or other expenses).
    
    Sukanya Samridhi Account: A Sukanya Samridhi Account can be opened at any time from the birth of a girl child till she attains the age of 10 years. Amount deposited in this account would be eligible for deduction under Section 80C.
    
    Note: You may invest in all or any of the above or other plans that may be notified by the Government / Income Tax department from time to time. Investments made by you are eligible for tax exemption up to a limit of Rs.1,50,000.
    
    For e.g. you may have a PF contribution of Rs.1,00,000, home loan principal payment of Rs.40,000, life insurance premium of Rs.10,000, and education expense of Rs.30,000. This makes your total investments Rs.1,80,000. However, you will get a deduction benefit only for Rs.1,50,000. The remaining Rs.30,000 will not be allowed as a deduction.
    
    Section 80CCC
    Pension Funds: Investments in certain pension funds are eligible for deduction from your income but the investment limit is clubbed with Section 80C. i.e. the total deduction available under Section 80CCC and 80C is Rs.1,50,000.
    
    Section 80CCD
    National Pension Scheme: Employees can contribute to Government-notified Pension Schemes (like National Pension Scheme – NPS).
